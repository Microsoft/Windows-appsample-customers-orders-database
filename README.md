# Customers Orders Database sample 

A UWP (Universal Windows Platform) sample app showcasing features useful to enterprise developers, like 
Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, UI controls (including a data grid), Sqlite and SQL Azure database integration, 
Entity Framework, and cloud API services. The sample is based around creating and managing customer accounts, orders, 
and products for the fictitious company Contoso. 

[Download and try it now from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PF1WCV13501). Visual Studio not required.

## What's new

- Local database connection using Sqlite. 
- Use of the repository pattern for easier testing and swapping between data sources with minimal code changes. 
- Splash screen and logo branding. 
- Diagnostic and feedback data collection control.
- Code quality improvements. 

## Features

This sample highlights: 

- The master/details UI pattern
- An editable DataGrid with input validation
- Form layouts
- Authenticating and obtaining user info using Azure Active Directory (AAD)
- Using the repository pattern to connect to Sqlite or SQL Azure databases
- Connecting to an external web API built with ASP.NET Core 2.0

## Run the sample

This sample is designed to connect to an instance of Azure Active Directory for authentication and an external service for data. 
To get you started right away, we've provided some demo data and a test service you can connect to. 
However, in order to debug and explore the full functionality of the app, you'll need to deploy your own instance to Azure.

### Quick start 

### Prepare your environment

This sample requires Visual Studio 2017, the Windows 10 Software Development Kit (SDK), and the .NET Core 2.0 SDK.

* [Get a free copy of Visual Studio 2017 with support for building Universal Windows apps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=280676)
* [Get the .NET Core 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

Additionally, to receive the latest updates to Windows and the development tools, and to help shape their development, join 
the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/ "Become a Windows Insider").

> *Note* If you are using Visual Studio 2015, a previous version of this sample which doesn't require Visual Studio 2017 is 
available in the git commit history for this repo.

### Run

Set your startup project as **Contoso.App**, the architecture to x86, and press F5 to run.

### Complete setup

To fully explore the sample, you'll need to connect to your own Azure Active Directory and data source. Values you need to fill 
are in [Constants.cs](ContosoRepository/Constants.cs). 

- **Client Id**: Set the *AccountClientId* field to your Azure account client Id.
- **API endpoint**: Set the value of the *BaseUrl* constant to match the url the backing service is running on.
- **Set a database connection string**: Set the connection string to one of your own local or remote databases.
- **Associate this sample with the Store**: Authentication requires store association. To associate the app with the Store, 
right click the project in Visual Studio and select **Store** -> *Associate App with the Store*. Then follow the instructions in the wizard.

You can then either start the service running locally, or deploy it to Azure. 

- To run locally, right-click the solution, choose *Properties*, and choose to start both **Contoso.App** and **Contoso.Service** at the same time. 
- To deploy to Azure, right-click Contoso.Service, choose *Publish*, and then follow the steps in the wizard.

## Design patterns

### Master/details

This sample demonstrates several flavors of the master/details pattern (side-by-side and stacked). 
The Customers list screen displays a customer list and a details overlay that lets the user view and edit a subset of customer data. 
The user can double-click to go to the full customer details screen, which shows additional data (such as the list of invoices 
associated with selected customer). 

The Orders list screen displays a list of orders. It uses visual state triggers to selectively display an additional details 
panel when the screen is large enough. To see the full details of an order or to edit it, the user double-clicks or selects "Edit" 
to go to the Order details screen. The Order details screen shows all the info for the order and enables editing. 
The user can search for additional products to add to the invoice.

### Form layouts

The two details screens show how to use headings, labels, and whitespace to organize controls into a form layout. Some controls used include:

- Layout controls: [Grid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Grid), 
[RelativePanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RelativePanel), 
[StackPanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel)
- Data controls: [Telerik RadDataGrid](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/universal-windows-platform/controls/raddatagrid/columns/datagrid-overview), 
[ListView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ListView), 
[AutoSuggestBox](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.AutoSuggestBox)
- Other controls: [Button](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Button), 
[HyperlinkButton](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.HyperlinkButton), 
[context menu](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/menus)

### Telerik RadDataGrid with data validation

This sample includes a Data Grid from Telerik's newly open-sourced UI for UWP controls library. You can find the source for these controls 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/UI-For-UWP), as well as a package on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Telerik.UI.for.UniversalWindowsPlatform). 
For help getting started, consult the [Telerik documentation](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/universal-windows-platform/). 

### Adaptive layouts

This sample demonstrates how to use visual states to adapt the UI for screen sizes varying from a 5 inch phone to a large desktop display. 
It also supports [Continuum for Phones](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/continuum), so you can use the app running on your 
Windows 10 phone on your Windows 10 PC. The app supports all versions of Windows 10, but new features are available on the latest versions. 
For example, the labels on command bar buttons are shown to the right of the icon on Windows 10, version 1607, but they are below 
the icon on previous versions of Windows 10.

## Known issues

* Data validation for non-US international phone numbers is not working correctly; the numbers will always show as invalid. 
This issue will be fixed in a future release.
